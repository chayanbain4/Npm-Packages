What is the purpose of the assert module in Node.js?
The assert module is used for testing by checking if specific conditions are met, throwing an error if a condition is false.

How does assert.strictEqual differ from assert.equal?
assert.strictEqual checks for both value and type equality, while assert.equal only checks for value equality.

What happens when an assertion fails in assert?
When an assertion fails, assert throws an error, which stops the code execution and shows the failure details.

How would you use assert to verify that a function returns a specific result?
By using assert.strictEqual(functionName(input), expectedOutput), we can check if the functionâ€™s output matches the expected value.

Can assert be used for testing asynchronous code?
Yes, assert can test asynchronous code when paired with async functions or callbacks, though frameworks like Mocha or Jest offer more features for async testing.

What types of tests are best suited for assert?
Simple, small-scale unit tests are well-suited for assert, especially when only basic condition checks are needed.

What is the benefit of using assert in test scripts?
assert is quick and easy to set up, making it ideal for lightweight testing scenarios without additional test dependencies.

What does assert.throws do?
assert.throws checks that a function throws an error when executed, useful for testing error handling.

Can you customize the error message in assert?
Yes, assert methods accept an optional custom error message as the last argument, displayed if the assertion fails.

How would you replace assert if your project needs advanced testing features?
For advanced testing, assert can be replaced with test frameworks like Jest or Mocha, which offer more extensive tools for async code, mock functions, and test reporting.
